The data I chose was an excel spreadsheet of aid committed by OECD countries for developing countries in the years 2009 and 2010. I narrowed down the countries to 4 in particular that I was interested in studying.

The chart begins at 0, as all column charts should. I chose the same color but in different intensity to show the relationship of the years. Both axes are labeled, and the vAxis units follow in the same format that I received the data in.

The chart I used was the basic column chart in Google Visualization

Overall title style and position: Arial, size 20, regular, black
The configuration options I used were:
Colors of the bar: set to two shades of pink
Width and height of the chart: set to 900 and 600
Gridline count of the hAxis: set to 7
Text style for both axes: Arial, size 12, regular, gray
Title text style for both axes: Arial, size 16, regular, gray
