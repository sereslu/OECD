The data I chose was an excel spreadsheet of aid committed by OECD countries for developing countries in the years 2009 and 2010. I narrowed down the countries to 4 in particular that I was interested in studying (commonwealth countries).

Data accessible here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AonYZs4MzlZbdGs3dFQzMVhlSXg0UEZqNE42cFltQlE#gid=0

Picked a Google visualization called "material" charts.

Luckily, the chart automatically set vAxis to begin at 0, as all column charts should. I chose the same pink color but in different intensity for the bars to show the relationship of the years (having different colors may lead the audience to think they are on different metrics)

hAxis: the countries I chose
vAxis: the amount of aid committed by each country

Annotation: chose to annotate the country rather than the bar itself
•	Overall title style and position: Arial, size 20, regular, black
•	The configuration options I used were:
•	Colors of the bar: set to two shades of pink
•	Width and height of the chart: set to 900 and 600
•	Gridline count of the vAxis, set to 6
•	Text style for both axes: Arial, size 12, regular, gray
•	Title text style for both axes: Arial, size 16, regular, gray
•	Annotation text style: Arial, size 10, gray

Problems I ran into:

-I wanted to position the annotation elsewhere, or to give it more room above and below it, but couldn't seem to find an option for that
-I wanted to shift the chart styles into my css file by setting variables for the different options, but my chart stopped working after that
